<small> These are the current bylaws for the league </small>

??? football "League Overview"
    **Platform** – Sleeper

    **Number of teams** – 12

    **Format** – Dynasty

??? podium "Draft"
    The draft is a “standard draft”, meaning all teams will draft at the same position each round. The annual rookie draft will typically be held the Sunday after the official NFL draft. The draft will consist of 3 rounds.

    Teams that made the playoffs in the previous season will be given a draft position based on how far they made it in the playoffs and their seeding. For example, the four teams that lose in round 1 of the playoffs will have picks 5,6,7, and 8, with the highest draft pick going to the highest seed in the playoffs. The 2 teams that lose in round 2 will be given picks 9 and 10, with pick 10 going to the higher original seed in the playoffs.

    Teams that did not make the playoffs will be given draft positions based solely on their MAX PF. "Max PF" stands for "Maximum Points For," which refers to the highest possible point total a team could have achieved each week based on their roster. The team with the lowest MAX PF will be given the 1st pick in the draft. 

??? player "Trades"

    All trades happen immediately after both teams have agreed to the terms of the deal. There will be no league "veto" option and the commissioner will not veto any trades unless there is suspicion of collusion. 

    In the event an owner suspects two teams of collusion they will bring it to the attention of the commissioner. The commissioner will then investigate these claims.

    The trade deadline is at the end of the final game of week 12 in the NFL. After this point a team cannot trade until they are not in the playoffs.

??? helmet "Waiver Wire"

    During the season, the league uses reverse standing waivers. Lower placed teams in the current standings will have the higher priority waiver pick each week.

    Directly after the season, the league will switch to rolling waivers. The last team to claim a player is placed at the bottom of waiver priority.

    On draft night, a waiver will not need to be put in for undrafted rookies (free for all).

    After the draft and until the season, the league will switch to original standing waivers. The team in first place will have first waiver wire pick each week.

    Players are held on waivers for 24 hours after being dropped

    Waivers are processed Tuesday morning at 2 a.m. central time

??? trophy "Playoffs"

    The Playoffs begin during week 14 of the NFL season and end with a two week championship game that takes place during weeks 16 & 17 of the NFL season. The playoffs consist of 3 rounds, with round 1 taking place during week 14 of the NFL, round 2 taking place during week 15 in the NFL, and round 3 (the championship) taking place during weeks 16 & 17 of the NFL.

    The 8 teams with the best win-loss record at the end of the regular season will enter the playoffs. If two teams have the same record, the team with the highest PF will enter the playoffs/have the higher seed.

    Teams will be seeded based on regular season record and PF tiebreakers. In round 1, the 1st seed will play the 8th seed, the 2nd seed will play the 7th seed, etc. Winners of round 1 will progress to play one of the other winners of round 1. The two winners of round 2 will compete in the championship.


??? dollar "League Dues/Payouts"

    Each team is required to pay $20 before the beginning of each season to a commissioner. If a team trades their 1st round draft pick for a future year, they will have to pay dues for that year at the time of the trade.

    The champion of the league will receive $220. The runner up will receive their league dues back for that year ($20).

??? stadium "Orphaned/Abandoned Teams"

    In the event a team is abandoned during the season the responsibility to find a new owner will be on the commissioner who will apply any and all methods to find a replacement. In the event an owner cannot be found for an abandoned team during the season the commissioner will take control of said team. The commissioner will set the abandoned teams line up with whatever players have the highest projected points for each week and approve trade for that team. All trades and starters selected by the commission will be reviewed and approved by at least one other owner of the league.

??? referee "Amendment/Rule Changes"

    Any team may propose an amendment or rule change to the commissioner. The commissioner will add the proposed rule change to the [list of proposed changes](../rules/proposed-changes.md) that will be discussed during the off season.
    
    All rule changes will be voted on by the entirety of the league.
    
    A rule must have 9/12 votes to be approved. If a vote receives 7/10 or 8/10, the amendment will have a revote after further discussing the change.
    
    All rule changes will take effect the following season by default unless otherwise stated.

    Any player who is within their first three years of being in the NFL is eligible to be put in a Taxi roster spot. The Taxi will be open during the offseason until NFL roster cuts.
